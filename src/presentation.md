# Project Aims

<!-- • The project aims to investigate and develop a tag-based file manager which will allow users to assign tags to their files and search for them based on those tags.
• This approach would be more efficient than current file management systems and would allow users to organise their files in a way that is suitable for them.
• The system should provide a search function which allows users to search for files based on their tags.
• The system should also be able to handle a large number of files and be easy to use for users with no knowledge of tagging or file management. -->


<!-- • Investigates and develops a tag-based file manager to enable efficient file management.
• Allows users to assign tags to their files, and then search for them based on those tags.
• Flexible and efficient compared to hierarchical directory structure.
• Search function to enable users to search for files based on their tags.
• Ability to handle a large number of files.
• Easy to use without prior knowledge of tagging or file management. -->

<!-- - The act of managing digital files is fundamental to computer usage, and the increasing number of digital files has made it more important to investigate effective methods of managing digital files.
- Current file management systems are not efficient when it comes to managing a large number of files.
  - These systems are based on a hierarchical structure (directory tree) which makes it difficult to search for files based on their content.
  - They are also not flexible when it comes to organising and retrieving files.
- Investigate and develop a tag-based file manager which allows users to assign tags to their files and search for those files based on those tags.
  - Provides a search function which enables users to search for files based on their tags.
  - Make the system easy to use for users with no prior knowledge of tagging or file management. -->

------

- Investigate and develop a tag-based file manager.
  - Allows users to assign tags to their files; provides a search function to search for files based on their tags.
  - Make the system easy to use for users with no prior knowledge of tagging or file management - UI is one of the focus of this project.

# Project Objectives

Research:

- To identify existing challenges related to PIM and file management.
- To compare and evaluate existing tagging software available to users.
- To gain an understanding of concepts related to PIM.
- To understand the needs of users when performing file management tasks.
- To investigate the challenges related to file management.

------

Implementation:

- To develop a system to allow users to manage and search files using tags.
- To implement a user interface that is easy to learn and efficient to use.

Evaluation:

- To evaluate the effectiveness of the prototype system through user testing.
- To evaluate the system against existing software systems.
- To conclude on the effectiveness of the system and to come up with recommendations for further work.

# Programme of Study

- Describe how your project is aligned with the learning outcomes of your programme of study.

> a slide on how your project in the line of the learning outcomes of your programme will study.

# Why is this a Engineering/Computing problem?

> "Why is this an engineering and computing problems?" The students always ask, what do you mean by this?
>
> Well, the problem you're solving, how are you using engineering or computing technologies to solve the problem? So that's what you have to sort of mention in this slide.

# Literature Review Findings

- How have others approached this, or a related, problem in the past?
- What lessons can be learned from what has been done before?
- Convince your supervisor that you have gained some knowledge about the background to the problem.
- Cite information sources / provide a list of references (add to the last slide)

> Literature review findings, this is a very important slide because what I want you to do is take a literature review and condense it into three or four bullet points, say exactly what your key findings are, what are the key challenges, and then this leads nicely to the next slide...

# What is your proposed solution?

- How will you solve the problem stated on the previous slides?
- Give an design overview of the structure of the solution.

> this leads nicely to the next slide, which is based on those challenges, the proposed solution for my project is this, or my implementation or experimentation is going to be designed in this way.
>
> Again, it's just an overview of the structure of the solution or the implementation work you're going to do. We're not expecting you to have all of this completed is just to give an idea to your assessors exactly what you intend to implement or whatever your practical element is.

# How will you evaluate your solution?

- State the evaluation/validation method and how this method has been used before.
- Why this method and not another?
- What are the benefits and risks of this method?

> Also, I want you to start thinking about your evaluation, how are you going to evaluate your system in the second semester?
>
> Start thinking about that now.
>
> I know this has not included the interim report, but it's very important you start thinking about that now because it's a good opportunity to have this information on this slide, which you can then discuss with your supervisors.

# Project Planning

- Gantt chart
  - Presents your project plan with achieved and future milestones.

> Project planning, Gantt chart, you will create a grant chart for the progress presentation, so you'd add an updated one.

# Risk Register

> Risk register is all to do with risk assessment for your project.
>
> There's a few videos you need to watch. There's a video about risk categories and there's a video about risk management. In this video, if you watch this video, there's an example of how to create a risk register for your project. What are the risks that you need to be aware of and what risks that you need to, how will you mitigate some of those risks to your project? So that's what you need to include. Again, you must watch this video, otherwise you will not be able to create a risk register.
