The programming language used

## Rust

Rust is a programming language designed by Graydon Hoare. It is designed to be memory-safe while still being performant [@balasubramanian2017system]. This is enforced by the Rust compiler, which checks memory-safety rules during compilation.

Rust is increasingly adopted by companies and projects such as Microsoft, Amazon, Cloudflare, and Facebook [@davison_2022_adoption]. It has also been integrated into the Linux kernel [@proven_2022_rust].

The author has no prior experience in low-level languages like C++ and Rust. The Rust language's memory-safety features and commercial support make it a good choice for the final project, as well as a good low-level language for the developer's arsenal.

## Tauri

Tauri is a Rust framework that allows developing desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, while using Rust for the backend [@tauricontributors_2022_tauriappstauri].

Rust is a relatively new language compared to other languages. It has many user interface libraries, however most of them are in the early stages of development and not yet fully-featured [@shivshank_2022_are].

Tauri uses web technologies for implementing user interfaces. This allows developers to use widgets and components from frontend frameworks such as Vue and React - developers are not limited to a small subset of widgets implemented by the library author.
