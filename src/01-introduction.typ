== Background

Computer users interact with digital files on a daily basis. This includes storing files, organising files, and retrieving files. The act of managing files and retrieving information is fundamental and necessary for general computer usage and many computer-based knowledge work. With modern systems and increased computer usage, the number of digital files on a user's system has increased significantly @dinneen2020ubiquitous.

This is related to the field of Personal Information Management (PIM). PIM is concerned with the management of digital files on the computer, and how people store, organise, and retrieve information to complete tasks. The increasing number of digital files on computer systems has made it more important than ever to investigate effective methods of managing digital files.

The directory tree structure is the de facto standard for data storage. Since its usage in early operating systems such as the OS/360 by IBM, most operating systems nowadays including Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux distributions use directory trees as the data storage method. In such a system, filenames are used to uniquely identify files, and files can be placed within directories or folders.

The most common way of storing data on a computer is by using a directory tree structure. Organising files in a directory tree is analogous to sorting paper documents in real life - users can organise files by placing them into folders and further subfolders. While this is an intuitive way of organising files due to its similarities to organisation in real life, it is not an efficient way of organising and recalling files.

Storage of files using a directory tree is trivial, since users can store files anywhere they wish. The main challenge arises when the user has a large amount of files, it can become difficult to organise and retrieve them. Users have to spend time to search through folders and subfolders, looking for the file they want. This makes file management a time-consuming task.

== Problem Statement

Current file management systems are not efficient when it comes to managing a large number of files. Trying to search for a particular file can be a very time-consuming process. The main reason for this is that these systems are based on a hierarchical structure which makes it difficult to search for files based on their content @DeVocht2012. This problem is compounded when the users have to deal with a large number of files which can be difficult to organise consistently and structurally.

There are many methods available for users to search for files. This can include search functions, browsing through folders, or even looking through the recent documents list. However, these methods can be time-consuming and often give imprecise results that fail to find the file the user wants. This is a major problem for users who have to deal with large numbers of files.

Another major problem with current file management systems is that they are not flexible when it comes to organising files. This is because they are based on a hierarchical structure which can be inflexible and difficult to use. This can make it difficult for users to organise their files in a way that is suitable for them.

== Aim

// This project is related to Personal Information Management (PIM). Particularly,

The project aims to investigate and develop a tag-based file manager. The system would allow users to assign tags to their files, and then search for those files based on those tags. The aim of this project is to develop a file management system which is more efficient than current systems, and which enables users to organise their files in a way that is suitable for them.

Compared to a hierarchical directory structure, a tag-based approach would allow users to organise their files in a more flexible and efficient way. Users would be able to assign arbitrary tags to their files then search for those files using those tags. This lets users avoid the time-consuming task of classifying files and browsing folders, for example deciding which single folder to place a file into @dinneen2020ubiquitous. This would also enable users to search for files based on their content, and would make it easier for users to manage their files.

Users would still be able to organise their files into folders if they so choose. However, the system would not impose any strict structure on users and would allow them to store their files in any way they want. This is in contrast to existing tagging software which often override any existing hierarchical file structure and do not allow any hierarchical organisation.

The system should provide a search function which would enable users to search for files based on their tags. This would make it easier for users to find the files they are looking for. The system should also be able to handle a large number of files, such that the software remains performant in tagging and searching for large numbers of files.

The system should also be easy to use, such that users can use it without any prior knowledge of tagging or file management. This is in contrast to existing tagging software which often have a steep learning curve, and require users to have some knowledge of tagging before they can be used effectively.

== Objectives

The objectives of the project are as follows:

- To identify existing challenges related to PIM and file management.
- To compare and evaluate existing tagging software available to users.
- To understand the needs of users when performing file management tasks.
- To gain an understanding of concepts related to PIM.
- To investigate the challenges related to file management.
- To develop a system to allow users to manage and search files using tags.
- To implement a user interface that is easy to learn and efficient to use.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of the prototype system through user testing.
- To evaluate the system against existing software systems.
- To conclude on the effectiveness of the system and to come up with recommendations for further work.

== Research Questions

The research questions for this project are as follows:

- How effective are existing solutions when it comes to managing a large number of files?
- What do users need from a file management system in order to manage their files effectively?
- Can a tag-based approach be used to improve the efficiency of file management?
