Reduce number of words

# Move actual aim to first bullet point, i.e. just switch slides 2 and 3

# Objectives: pretty good, can you condense it a bit?
# This part would take about 2 mi itrs

Programme of study:
Not sure what the purpose of this slide, but required by qmul
Get through these slides quickly, it's boring

# Concepts: good
# Previous approaches: good

Risks
Hard drive crashes - upload on GitHub
Tauri has breaking update - stay in old version
Found users for testing, but they don't respond
Think of things you don't have control over, like natural disasters


Content overall is good
Presentation wise, try to get rid of some detail

# Some more visuals would be nice
# E.g. screenshot, demo, diagrams etc
# Include a part where you demonstrate the software, that'd be good

Also good to improvise a bit, not just reading from the slides

Try to shorten the A1 A2 A3 stuff



Next week is last meeting for semester
