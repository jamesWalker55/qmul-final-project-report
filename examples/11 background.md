The leading cause of obesity is calorie overconsumption: the intake of more calories than are burned off through physical activity (Global Food Security, 2016). As of September 2019, nearly 40% of adults in America are medically obese – the highest rate documented by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2019). Between 2014-2015 the NHS spent £6.1 billion on obesity and its related diseases (Public Health England, 2017). Obesity is one of the significant underlying risk factors to several non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including premature heart disease, diabetes and stroke (Public Health England, 2017). Thus, highlighting that the global obesity epidemic is posing both a substantial economic cost and a health risk to the world population.

There are several existing calorie tracking applications available to users who aim to sustain healthy lifestyles. Apps such as Lose It! and MyFitnessPal focus on user input of exercise and food intake. However, such applications go no further in analysing the resulting calorie balances, providing no suggestions to help users to meet their daily goals (FitNow, 2009) (MyFitnessPal, 2014). Thus, meaning users often become disengaged in using the applications once the novelty wears off. In addition, existing applications have downfalls in usability, leading to reduced motivation and hindrance in adoption (Lee, et al., 2006).

# Voice Based Email for the Blind

We are at the edge of a technological revolution that will essentially change the way we live, work and communicate with one another. This is known as the fourth industrial revolution. Communication is a core factor to society’s foundation. It helps to simplify and facilitate the process of sharing information and knowledge with others in conjunction with helping people establish key relationships. The development of technology such as the internet, text messaging and smartphones have widely transformed the way in which people communicate.

One principle method of online communication is email. Email is a fast and reliable means of effective communication. It has many uses such as overcoming barriers, providing wide access, facilitating face to face contact and providing a service. Nowadays it is essential for everyone to have an email address. However, to compose and read emails for the visually impaired can be challenging as all activity performed on computers is based on visual perception. Accessibility serves as one of the founding pillars of user experience and design (Mistry, 2019). Many email marketers do not take into consideration the population of those with visual disabilities and thus make reading emails a challenge.

Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment or blindness (Who.int, 2019). Some visually challenged people may not be computer literate thus, will find it difficult to use screen readers that require keyboard input. Therefore, a multimodal system that uses interactive voice response without the use of a keyboard is crucial to make email communication efficient and seamless to the visually impaired user.

# Programming By Demonstration Of Human Decision In A Human-Robot Collaborative Sorting Task

The vision for Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is to make robots a trustworthy team member. Many robots like the UR5 are being developed to help us perform better through collaborative tasks. The advantage of Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is to allow robots to perform different tasks, and not be limited to just performing one repetitive task. It can be complicated to program a robot to work in a flexible working environment. PbD is a common way of recording the reusable actions of human through user demonstration. This can allow robots to understand and imitate human demonstrations, such as keen decision-making ability which robots can efficiently imitate through PbD.

The design of this project is to equip an industrial robotic arm (UR5) with Robot Vision technology via an RGB-D camera to capture objects and movements. This would allow us to develop an autonomous system to perform a collaborative shared task with a human. This robot automation could be done by inputting a state transition model in the form of FSM (Finite State Machine), which allows the robotic arm to understand the sequence of the task it needs to execute. The robotic arm would be able to then schedule a specific task corresponding to human demonstration, therefore, allowing the robot to handle all the different possible executions the human partner may perform.

This paper uses object-oriented recognition by labelling objects with unique markers sorted by types, allowing the robot to detect the location and track the movement of objects. The actual task model will be programmed manually and given in advance to the robotic arm so that the robot will be able to execute and understand the sequence of collaborative tasks. The FSM task model includes every state the robot may act during the task and contains the possible transitions from the current state. This project views the human-robot collaborative sorting task as an attempt of PbD, where the robotic arm help humans to sort the numbers of cubes that are marked with ARUCO into specified subareas on a tabletop (where we use ARUCO boards on the working platform). The task executed by the robotic arm is based on a pick-and-place motion, a typical robotic arm application. The ARUCO marker is considered as an effective approach for the robot to recognize objects in 2D dimensional space.

# A tool to retrieve and browse templates of marketing material to help the worldwide charity sector

This section provides a brief overview about Br&.ish and their organisation. In order to have a clear understanding of the reason behind the propose development of this new system, the company’s existing practice will also be presented here.

## 2.1 Br&.ish

Br&.ish is a multidisciplinary design company (Br&.ish, 2012) which is founded in 2010 by Elliot Cowan. He is also the Creative Director of the company. It currently employs six employees and their UK office is located at West Hampstead. Br&.ish operates globally as they also have a sister company in the USA called “Here’s My Chance”. Apart from Elliot, Br&.ish has a Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Intern Manager, Interns and a wide group of freelance artists who are responsible in the creative areas such as graphic designing, web designing, video production and post production. Br&.ish specialises in providing branding materials such as flyers, posters, newsletters, brochures and newsletters to Jewish non-profit organisations around the world. Apart from branding materials, the company also offers other services such as providing fundraising materials, designing clothes as well as creating logos and websites (Br&.ish, 2012). They provide their services to companies who do not have enough resources, such as money, time and people, to make their branding materials.

# Interactive Query Expansion

The problem of retrieving information has been apparent for a long time. It can be dated to the days of Plato (Van Rij sbergen, 1995).

> “And how will you enquire, Socrates, into that which you did not know?... if you ?nd what
> you want, how will you ever [mow that this is the thing which you did not know?...a man
> cannot enquire either about that which he lmmvs, or about that which he does not know: for
> if he knows, he has no need to enquire; and if not, he cannot; for he does not know the very
> subject about which he is to enquire ” — Plato

To this day, some of the issues in this paradoxical quote persist in the area of information retrieval (IR). Searchers and it difficult to identify the correct words to formulate their information needs and if their queries are not phrased appropriately, there is likely to be a negative impact on the results they receive from the search system. Therefore, to ensure that users are able to get the best set of results that meet their information needs, it is of utmost importance to provide assistance to users of IR systems.

Neither the user nor the system is able to solve the information problem independently. Therefore, they should complement each other (Brajnik et al., 2002). The system should provide certain features to assist users, especially those users Who have little or no knowledge about the area of their search. Searchers are often not able to exploit features being provided to them by the system. Sometimes When searchers assess retrieved documents, they are not able to fully exploit the information they collect. For example, When searchers judge a document as being relevant, they could extract some terms from that document to better reformulate their query in order to retrieve more similar documents (Marchionini, 1989; Sullivan et a1, 1990; Vollaro & Hawkins, 1986). One of the main difficulties that users of IR systems face is how to choose appropriate search terms to express their information need in the form of a query.

One of the ways to assist searchers is through Query Expansion, in Which an IR system tries to improve user queries by adding related terms to the original query. The new formulation of the query, With the added expansion terms: aims at improving the effectiveness of the search.

Query Expansion exists in two types= namely Automatic Query Expansion (AQE) and Interactive Query Expansion (IQE).

Automatic query expansion is Where the retrieval system automatically adds words to the query and the user has no control over Which terms have been added during the search (Efthimiadis, 2000). Ruthven (Ruthven, 2003) argues that AQE is often favourable as the system has access to more statistical information on how useful expansion terms could be. Thus, the system can select the terms that would be best for the results.

Interactive query expansion: on the other hand: is the case Where the user indicates Which expansion terms should be added to their query. Searchers are usually presented With a list of terms generated by the system and they can choose terms Which are relevant to their query. The user-selected terms are then added to the initial query. This type of expansion is often preferred by users as it offers them more control. Koenemann and Belkin (Koenemann and Belkin= 1996) provide evidence that searchers may prefer the interactive method regardless of whether it improves performance.
