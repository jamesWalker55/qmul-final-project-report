# StepMyHealth

Chapter two explored the research conducted in the area of mobile health tracking. Three significant themes were studied: Electronic Applications Integrating with Health Tracking, The Effects of Gamification in Mobile Health Tracking Applications and The Impact of Interface Design on Usability within Calorie Tracking Applications. Current calorie tracking applications were analysed, with details of their benefits and drawbacks.

Chapter three detailed the resulting functional and non-functional requirements for the system alongside several design diagrams.

Chapter four specified the implementation of StepMyHealth, including the technologies and methodologies used. Each of the main features within the application was explained.

Chapter five discussed how StepMyHealth was tested including both the development tests and user tests carried out.

Chapter six looked at the overall outcome of the project. The aims, objectives and research questions initially set out at the beginning of the project were evaluated against the final implementation. The limitations of the project were also discussed.

Chapter seven explored the legal, social and ethical issues that were considered during implementation. Retrospective issues highlighted by the evaluation have also been discussed.

Chapter eight detailed a personal reflection of the challenges and achievements throughout the project. Ideas for future work on the project have been presented.

Chapter nine consisted of the bibliography. The full references for sources mentioned throughout the report can be found here.
