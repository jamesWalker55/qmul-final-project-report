# StepMyHealth

- To investigate the existing calorie tracking applications available to users
- To identify the challenges related to self-reporting systems
- To use the current research available to understand the impact of different functionalities on the effectiveness of calorie tracking applications
- To develop an iOS application to allow users to track their calorie consumption calories burned easily
- To implement an algorithm that can determine how many calories the user has over/under-consumed and provide suggestions based off of this outcome
- To perform user testing to conclude the effectiveness of the application
- To utilise the results from user testing to evaluate the application’s effectiveness against existing applications

# Voice Based Email for the Blind

In order to achieve the aim of this project, the following objectives must be reached:

- To compare and contrast existing models and establish key features and limitations of those systems
- To gain an understanding of relevant concepts such as text to speech, speech to text and interactive voice response.
- Data will be collected from visually impaired users by conducting interviews on ways in which email is currently used before implementation.
- To identify and treat business risks.
- To implement a user interface that can be easily accessible by the text to speech system
- To create and develop a system that will be accessible to visually impaired users using interactive voice response.
- To ensure more productivity for users by incorporating speech to text technology.
- To comply with rules, regulations, standards and practices.
- To test out the application after completion
- To produce an application that allows users to navigate through the Gmail email client performing functions such as composing email using only voice.

# Programming By Demonstration Of Human Decision In A Human-Robot Collaborative Sorting Task

## 1.4.1 To Construct the State Transition Model

The main objective of this paper is to construct a proper and efficient state transition model to enable the robot in understanding the design task beforehand. This would therefore allow robots to collaborate with human in all possible situations of work flows. The transition model will be demonstrated and created in a type of FSM for early modelling on paper and will later on be programmed in ROS package by using SMATCH python library. This will be investigated in detail later in Chapter 3.

## 1.4.2 To Construct ARUCO Marker Image Recognition Algorithms Adapted with ROS

In order to visualize the data from the camera sensor, this paper uses ARUCO maker to make the detecting and tracking more efficient. The image recognition algorithm of the ARUCO marker will be done by using marker and OpenCV library of python in ROS.

## 1.4.3 To Have Experimental Study with ROS Programming and Industrial Robots

Another very important objective of this paper is to get familiar with ROS (Robot Operating System), where it will be working on controlling the industrial robotic arm (UR5) through programming over the ROS and building communications between each layer. This becomes the fundamental investigation of this project, that is, being able to program a proposed system in a ROS package for performing complex tasks.

## 1.4.4 To Have Some Investigation on Particular PbD, HRC, and Vision

This project targets the core topics of robotics, which includes the following: HRC, Vision, and PbD. During the progress of the investigation, it is expected to gain further insight of Robotics when achieving the stated aim.

## 1.4.5 To Research About the Current Development of Robotics Related to the Software

In order to build an advanced robot system, existing research on the current development of the ROS and robotics is vital because this could bring new inspirations of approaches and analysis. In particular, the reuse and improvement of existing open-source contribution can be more effective in finishing this project with better quality than expected.

# A tool to retrieve and browse templates of marketing material to help the worldwide charity sector

_(This section is called **Motivation and Challenges** instead)_

Nowadays, different companies and non-profit organisations often employ a branding strategy that best represents what they have to offer to their customers. According to (Harker, 2011), “In 2007/08, there were 171,074 general registered charities in the UK.” With this high number of general registered charities in the UK, branding and identity design, therefore, are an important factor to survive in this environment (Khan & Ede, 2009). However, small and medium-sized organisations often see branding as an additional cost and they lack resources to employ a branding professional that will help them design their marketing materials such as brochures, leaflets and business cards (Brand Channel, 2003). Br&.ish has used this opportunity to provide the marketing material resources for the worldwide charity sector to use. Therefore, the completion of this project will provide benefits not only to the company but also to their charity clients. The existing facts have motivated the author of this report to deliver a system that will be used by different charities worldwide.

The main challenge in doing this project will be creating a final working system that Br&.ish will want to use. Learning new and advanced techniques in JQuery, PHP and MySQL is also another challenge as this project will need to have a certain level of complexity and depth. Lastly, time management and good project management planning are also big challenges in delivering the project on time as there will also be other coursework deadlines to be submitted apart from this final project.
