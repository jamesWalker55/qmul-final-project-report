# StepMyHealth

This project aimed to build an iOS application that helped users track their calorie consumption efficiently. There are several calorie tracking applications currently available on the App store, but such applications have downfalls. The applications that exist do not provide users with intake recommendations. Also, many of the applications have usability issues, the main problem of which relates to the cluttered design of user interfaces. Such design issues have led to a lack of user engagement. Furthermore, existing applications implement limited uses of gamification elements. Thus, do not fully utilise the motivational potential of gamification within calorie tracking.

StepMyHealth aimed to implement features and design elements to solve these issues within a single application.

StepMyHealth aimed to provide regular intake recommendations to users based on their current calorie balance. The automated calculation, using the accelerometer data collected from the device intended to reduce the overheads associated with the manual input of distance metrics.

In addition, StepMyHealth aimed to implement gamification features to motivate users in reaching their calorie goals. The main element of gamification used was a leaderboard, allowing users to compare their calorie progress to others. The leaderboard aimed to encourage users to remain within their daily calorie balance.

StepMyHealth also aimed to provide a simple, easy to use interface for tracking, ensuring users were not overwhelmed by information. The aim was to attract users not only in the short term but for prolonged durations, such that the simplicity of the application would lead the integration of calorie tracking into users’ lifestyles.

The combination of these features aimed to provide users with an engaging, easy to use, effective calorie-tracking mobile application - StepMyHealth.

# Voice Based Email for the Blind

This project aims to help navigate visually impaired users through the Gmail email client using their voice. Users are able to compose and listen to emails through technologies such as speech to text, text to speech and interactive voice response. Moreover, this overcomes the disadvantages of the existing system in that it is fully voice-based as the system works on vocal abilities, reducing the software load of using screen readers and user's cognitive load on remembering keyboard shortcuts.

# Programming By Demonstration Of Human Decision In A Human-Robot Collaborative Sorting Task

The project aims to implement a system that allows the robotic arm to learn from human demonstrations and assist in a Human-Robot collaboration sorting task. By using an external camera sensor, the system can recognize human demonstrations by tracking objects. The idea of the system is to use the concept of PbD to control the robot that performs the task without programming it. In addition, the system will be developed through natural programming on Kinetic ROS distribution. Finally, the project will use the Gazebo simulator and then use a real UR5 robotic arm to perform the experiment on the system with shared sequencing tasks.

# A tool to retrieve and browse templates of marketing material to help the worldwide charity sector

The primary aim of this project is to design and implement a fully operational database system for a design company called Br&.ish within six months in order for the worldwide charity sector to browse different marketing material templates. The marketing material templates to be browsed by the charity sector are posters, brochures, flyers, newsletters and booklets. In effect, the database system will store different information such as user’s details, the marketing material templates and the category it belongs too as well as its different parameters. Parameters include the size of the template, its page orientation whether it is a landscape or portrait, its main colours, the font style, font size and font colour used.

The project’s sub-aims are also as follows:

- To design a user interface system for the Br&.ish operators in order for them to categorise marketing material templates into different categories. The Br&.ish operators are the back end users who are responsible in displaying media content to the Br&.ish website.
- To design a user interface system for the Br&.ish operators that will allow them to define or edit information about the marketing material templates. This information includes adding keywords to a template, removing keywords from a template, removing the template from added categories or deleting the template itself.
- To integrate this project into the other projects proposed by Br&.ish. These other projects are further explained in section 2.3 of this report. This system integration will be vital in the deployment of a whole working system that Br&.ish will want to use.
